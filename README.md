Hi there, here i will share some recipes that we(me and my wife) tried to produce or created based on others.
We decide to produce our own fragances to user with our own arome diffuser - a tradicional one, but other project that will be produce with [arduino](www.arduino.cc) or [esp](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32).
